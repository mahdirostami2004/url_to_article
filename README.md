## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahdirostami2004/url_to_article.git
cd url_to_article
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python3 -m app.main
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter a target URL
2. Select desired fields (title, text, links)
3. Choose export format
4. The crawler:

   * Validates the website
   * Fetches HTML content
   * Parses and extracts data
   * Exports structured output

---

## 📊 Example Output

### JSON

```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "title": "Example Domain",
    "text": "This domain is for use in illustrative examples...",
    "links": ["https://www.iana.org/domains/example"]
  }
]
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Some websites block scraping (anti-bot protection)
* No JavaScript rendering (static HTML only)
* No multi-page crawling (single URL only)

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

* [ ] Async crawler (aiohttp)
* [ ] Proxy rotation
* [ ] JavaScript rendering (Playwright)
* [ ] Link-based crawling (multi-depth)
* [ ] Export to Excel
* [ ] Advanced UI (dashboard)
